qemu.utils package
==================

This package provides misc utilities used for testing and debugging
QEMU. It is used most directly by the qemu.machine package, but has some
uses by the vm and acceptance tests for determining accelerator support.

See the documentation in ``__init__.py`` and ``accel.py`` for more
information.
