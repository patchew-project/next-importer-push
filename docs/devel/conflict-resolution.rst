Conflict Resolution Policy
==========================

Conflicts in the community can take many forms, from someone having a
bad day and using harsh and hurtful language on the mailing list to more
serious code of conduct violations (including sexist/racist statements
or threats of violence), and everything in between.

For the vast majority of issues, we aim to empower individuals to first
resolve conflicts themselves, asking for help when needed, and only
after that fails to escalate further. This approach gives people more
control over the outcome of their dispute.

How we resolve conflicts
------------------------

If you are experiencing conflict, you should first address the perceived
conflict directly with other involved parties, preferably through a
real-time medium such as IRC. If this fails, get a third-party (e.g. a
mutual friend, and/or someone with background on the issue, but not
involved in the conflict) to intercede or mediate.

If you are witnessing conflict, you should also first try to address it
directly by interceding or mediating between the involved parties.

If a good faith effort towards resolving the conflict fails,
escalate to the QEMU leadership committee by sending email at
qemu@sfconservancy.org. It is strongly suggested to include evidence of
past effort towards resolving the conflict.

The QEMU leadership committee will do its best to review the incident
timely, and will either seek further information, or will make a
determination on next steps.

Note: If the behaviour is threatening/harassing and requires immediate
escalation, contact the QEMU leadership committee immediately before
trying other steps, and possibly inform one or more members through IRC.
The up-to-date list of members is `available on the QEMU wiki
<https://wiki.qemu.org/Conservancy>`__.

Remedies
--------

Escalating an issue to the QEMU leadership committee may result in actions
impacting one or more involved parties. In the event the leadership
committee has to intervene, here are some of the ways they might respond:

1. Take no action. For example, if the leadership committee determines
the complaint has not been substantiated or is being made in bad faith,
or if it is deemed to be outside its purview.

2. A private reprimand, explaining the consequences of continued behavior,
to one or more involved individuals.

3. A private reprimand and request for a private or public apology

4. A public reprimand and request for a public apology

5. A public reprimand plus a mandatory cooling off period. The cooling
off period may require, for example, one or more of the following:
abstaining from maintainer duties; not interacting with people involved,
including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the guidelines
and interaction on social media; being denied participation to in-person
events.  The cooling off period is voluntary but may escalate to a
temporary ban in order to enforce it.

6. A permanent or temporary ban from some or all QEMU spaces (mailing
lists, IRC, wiki, etc.). The group will maintain records of all such
bans so that they may be reviewed in the future, extended to new fora,
or otherwise maintained.

In the event of severe harassment, the leadership comittee may advise that
the matter be escalated to the relevant local law enforcement agency. It
is however not the role of the leadership comittee to initiate contact
with law enforcement on behalf of any of the community members involved
in an incident.
