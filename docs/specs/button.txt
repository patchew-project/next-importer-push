BUTTON DEVICE
=================

The button device communicates the host's "lid button" state to the guest.
The probing of the host's lid button state occurs on timed intervals.
If a change of the host's lid button state is detected (open/closed)
an ACPI notification is sent to the guest, so it will be able to act
accordingly.

The time interval between the periodic probes is 2 s by default.
A property 'probe_interval' allows to modify this value. The value
is provided in milliseconds.

The host's lid button information is taken from:

/proc/acpi/button/lid/*/state

And this file is expected to be formatted as:
'state:      open' (if the lid is open)
or:
'state:      closed' (if the lid is closed)

These are based on the Linux 'button' driver.

If the above procfs path differs, or even if a "fake" host lid button
is to be provided, a 'procfs_path' property allows to override the
default path.

Usage example (default values):

'-device button'

Is the same as:

'-device button,procfs_path=/proc/acpi/button,probe_interval=2000'
