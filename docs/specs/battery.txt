BATTERY DEVICE
==============

The battery device communicates the host's battery state to the guest.
The probing of the host's battery state occurs on guest ACPI requests,
as well as on timed intervals. If a change of the host's battery state is
detected on one of the timed probes (charging/discharging, rate, charge)
an ACPI notification is sent to the guest, so it will be able to
update its battery status accordingly.

The time interval between periodic probes is 2 s by default. A property
'probe_interval' allows to modify this value. The value should be
provided in milliseconds. A zero value disables the periodic probes,
and makes the battery state updates occur on guest requests only.

The host's battery information is taken from the sysfs battery data,
located in:

/sys/class/power_supply/[device of type "Battery"]

If the sysfs path differs, a different battery needs to be probed,
or even if a "fake" host battery is to be provided, a 'sysfs_path'
property allows to override the default one.
