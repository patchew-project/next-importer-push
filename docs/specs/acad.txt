AC ADAPTER DEVICE
=================

The AC adapter device communicates the host's AC adapter state to the
guest. The probing of the host's AC adapter state occurs on guest ACPI
requests, as well as on timed intervals. If a change of the host's AC
adapter state is detected on one of the timed probes (connected/disconnected)
an ACPI notification is sent to the guest, so it will be able to
update its AC adapter status accordingly.

The time interval between the periodic probes is 2 s by default.
A property 'probe_interval' allows to modify this value. The value
should be provided in milliseconds. A zero value disables the periodic
probes, and makes the AC adapter state updates occur on guest requests
only.

The host's AC adapter information is taken from the sysfs AC adapter
data, located in:

/sys/class/power_supply/[device of type "Mains"]

If the sysfs path differs, a different AC adapter needs to be probed,
or even if a "fake" host AC adapter is to be provided, a 'sysfs_path'
property allows to override the default one.
