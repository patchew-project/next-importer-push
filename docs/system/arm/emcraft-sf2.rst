Emcraft SmartFusion2 SOM kit (``emcraft-sf2``)
==============================================

The ``emcraft-sf2`` board emulates the SmartFusion2 SOM kit from
Emcraft (M2S010). This is a System-on-Module from EmCraft systems,
based on the SmartFusion2 SoC FPGA from Microsemi Corporation.
The SoC is based on a Cortex-M4 processor.

At the moment only the system timer, system registers and SPI
controller are modelled.
