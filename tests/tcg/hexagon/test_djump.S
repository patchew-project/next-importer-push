/* Purpose: show dual jumps actually work. This program features a packet where
 * two jumps should (in theory) be performed if !P0. However, we correctly
 * handle the situation by performing only the first one and ignoring the second
 * one. This can be verified by checking that the CPU dump contains 0xDEADBEEF
 * in R2.
