/**
 * block_signals: block all signals while handling this guest syscall
 *
 * Block all signals, and arrange that the signal mask is returned to
 * its correct value for the guest before we resume execution of guest code.
 * If this function returns non-zero, then the caller should immediately
 * return -TARGET_ERESTARTSYS to the main loop, which will take the pending
 * signal and restart execution of the syscall.
 * If block_signals() returns zero, then the caller can continue with
 * emulation of the system call knowing that no signals can be taken
 * (and therefore that no race conditions will result).
 * This should only be called once, because if it is called a second time
 * it will always return non-zero. (Think of it like a mutex that can't
 * be recursively locked.)
 * Signals will be unblocked again by process_pending_signals().
 *
 * Return value: non-zero if there was a pending signal, zero if not.
