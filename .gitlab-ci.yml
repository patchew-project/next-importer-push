# Only documentation or comments is accepted.

# To use a different set of jobs than the mainstream QEMU project,
# you need to set the location of your custom yml file at "custom CI/CD
# configuration path", on your GitLab CI namespace:
# https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ci/pipelines/settings.html#custom-cicd-configuration-path

#
# QEMU CI jobs are based on templates. Some templates provide
# user-configurable options, modifiable via configuration variables.
# Refer to 'workflow.yml' for guidance on how to trigger non-default
# jobs using git push options, or special branch names
