This is the upstream QEMU issue tracker.

Before submitting a bug, please attempt to reproduce your problem using
the latest development version of QEMU obtained from
https://gitlab.com/qemu-project/qemu/.

QEMU generally supports the last two releases advertised via
https://www.qemu.org/. Problems with distro-packaged versions of QEMU
older than this should be reported to the distribution instead.

See https://www.qemu.org/contribute/report-a-bug/ for guidance.
