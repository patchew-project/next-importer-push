QEMU Advent Calendar 2020 is around the corner and we are looking for                                                                                                                                                                                                     volunteers to contribute disk images that showcase something cool, bring
back retro computing memories, or simply entertain with a puzzle or game.

QEMU Advent Calendar publishes a QEMU disk image each day from
December 1-24. Each image is a surprise designed to delight an audience
consisting of the QEMU community and beyond. You can see previous
years at [https://www.qemu-advent-calendar.org/](https://www.qemu-advent-calendar.org/)

You can help us make this year's calendar awesome by:
 * [Sending disk images](mailto:eldon-qemu@eldondev.com?Subject=QEMU 2020 advent disk image)
 * Sending ideas for disk images

Here are the requirements for disk images:
 * Content must be freely redistributable (i.e. no proprietary
   license that prevents distribution). For GPL based software,
   you need to provide the source code, too.
 * Provide a name and a short description of the disk image
   (e.g. with hints on what to try)
 * Provide a ./run shell script that prints out the name and
   description/hints and launches QEMU
 * Provide a 320x240 screenshot/image/logo for the website
 * Size should be ideally under 100 MB per disk image
   (but if some few images are bigger, that should be OK, too)

Check out [this disk
image](https://www.qemu-advent-calendar.org/2018/download/day24.tar.xz) as an
example of how to distribute an image. Links to files over 25MB are appreciated
in lieu of email attachments.

PS: QEMU Advent Calendar is a secular calendar (not
religious). The idea is to create a fun experience for the QEMU
community which can be shared with everyone. You don't need
to celebrate Christmas or another religious festival to participate!
